    "It is said that [infinite monkeys typing for an infinite amount of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) will eventually type, among other things, the complete works of Wiliam Shakespeare. Let's see if we can get there a bit faster, with the power of Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM.\n",

    "Use it as training data for an RNN - you can keep it simple and train character level, and that is suggested as an initial approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use that trained RNN to generate Shakespearean-ish text. Your goal - a function that can take, as an argument, the size of text (e.g. number of characters or lines) to generate, and returns generated text of that size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - Shakespeare wrote an awful lot. It's OK, especially initially, to sample/use smaller data and parameters, so you can have a tighter feedback loop when you're trying to get things running. Then, once you've got a proof of concept - start pushing it more!"

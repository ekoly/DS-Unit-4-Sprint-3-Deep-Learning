    "It is said that [infinite monkeys typing for an infinite amount of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) will eventually type, among other things, the complete works of Wiliam Shakespeare. Let's see if we can get there a bit faster, with the power of Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM.\n",

    "Use it as training data for an RNN - you can keep it simple and train character level, and that is suggested as an initial approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use that trained RNN to generate Shakespearean-ish text. Your goal - a function that can take, as an argument, the size of text (e.g. number of characters or lines) to generate, and returns generated text of that size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - Shakespeare wrote an awful lot. It's OK, especially initially, to sample/use smaller data and parameters, so you can have a tighter feedback loop when you're trying to get things running. Then, once you've got a proof of concept - start pushing it more!"

      "\"Boys On The Docks\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"Boys On The Docks\" (dedicated to the memory of John Kelly) Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. United we stand, divided we fall. Together we are what we can't be alone, We came to this country, you made it our home. This man so humble, this man so brave. A legend to many, he fought to his grave. Saved family and friends from the hardship and horror, in a land of depression he gave hope for tomorrow. Say Johnny me boy, this ones for you. With the strength of many and the courage of few. To what do we owe this man who's fight was for the masses, he gave his life. Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call United we stand, divided we fall. Together we are what we can't be alone, We came to this country, you made it our home. A friend to the locals who dabbled in crime. He'd give you a job and he'd give you his time. He wasn't a crook, but he couldn't be conned. John knew the difference between right and wrong. Say Johnny me boy, you live no longer, Others forgotten, your memory's stronger. Lets drink to the causes in your life: Your family, your friends, the union, your wife. Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. United we stand, divided we fall. Together we are what we can't be alone. We came to this country, you made it our home. [x2] And the boys on the docks needed John for sure. When they came to this country he opened the door. He said \"Man I'll tell ya, they don't like our kind. Though it starts with a fist it must end with your mind.\" Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. United we stand, divided we fall. Together we are what we can't be alone. We came to this country you made it our home.

Careening toward an early death, a streetwise man; On the corner every night.  So brace-for impact, brace-for impact, brace-for impact, why don't you brace.  the end is coming, no time for running.  Dealing drugs to little kids, a streetwise man. Selling death and making cash. Pulling scams and moving bids, a streetwise man. Society has called my bluff tonight.  So brace-for impact, brace-for impact, brace-for impact, why don't you brace.  the end is coming, no time for running.  The end is coming, no time for running now!

      "\"Caps And Bottles\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"Caps And Bottles\" When I was 13 I bought a scally cap Looked up to the older guys who drank at the Rat Couldn't wait to grow up just to drink with the crew Put my name on the map and have a social few. I recall when I was small I thought I'd be a legend soon But that was then and this is now A harder road could not be found Don't get me wrong good times were had Sometimes the fun outweighed the bad But all in all now said and done I can recall more bad than fun. It's killing me - the answers here, it's plain to see It's killing me - I'm half the man I thought I'd be It's killing me - It's taken years but now I see It's taken years but now I see I'm not the man I'd thought I'd be. I'd fight them all big or small, Angel dust and bud tall Collars up and fists the same Protect your friends and family name Had my lumps, received a few But not near what I deserved Some say this life's my punishment Some say this life's my justice served.

      "\"Far Away Coast\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"Far Away Coast\" Here in the trenches the fist of the Beast For fear of an atmosphere poisoned deceased With a gas mask to keep me from breathing my death It's American soil I hope for at best But the duty I serve can't begin to compare To my ancestors battles and wars through the years Though the loneliness strikes like an enemy shell I pray for my home but still sit here in hell. [Chorus:] Sail away to a place that's unknown Taken away from my friends and my home To a place they call sacred A place I call hell I long for that corner I once knew so well. Go to the grind it's all that I have Work on and on with nothing to show But a graying face in this dying place That's a lock in my solitude I think of a place on a faraway coast Where friends are so dear and there's reason to toast A cloudy image of a Middle East land Comes down and wrecks my hopeful thoughts.

Together we are what we can't be alone, We came to this country, you made it our home. This man so humble, this man so brave. A legend to many, he fought to his grave. Saved family and friends from the hardship and horror, in a land of depression he gave hope for tomorrow. Say Johnny me boy, this ones for you. With the strength of many and the courage of few. To what do we owe this man who's fight was for the masses, he gave his life. Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call United we stand, divided we fall. Together we are what we can't be alone, We came to this country, you made it our home. A friend to the locals who dabbled in crime. He'd give you a job and he'd give you his time. He wasn't a crook, but he couldn't be conned. John knew the difference between right and wrong. Say Johnny me boy, you live no longer, Others forgotten, your memory's stronger. Lets drink to the causes in your life: Your family, your friends, the union, your wife. Say hey Johnny boy, the battle call. United we stand, divided we fall. Together we are what we can't be alone. We came to this country, you made it our home. [x2] And the boys on the docks needed John for sure. When they came to this country he opened the door.

      "\"The Rocky Road To Dublin (Traditional)\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"The Rocky Road To Dublin (Traditional)\" In the merry month of June, From my home I started, Left the girls of Tuam, Nearly broken hearted, Saluted me father dear, Kissed me darling mother, Drank a pint of beer, My grief and tears to smother, Then off to reap the corn, And leave where I was born, Cut a stout blackthorn, To banish ghost and goblin, In a brand new pair of brogues, go rattling o'er the bogs, Frightening all the dogs, On the rocky road to Dublin. One, two, three, four, five In Mullingar last night, I rested limbs so weary, Started by daylight, Next morning bright and early, Took a drop of the pure, To keep my heart from sinking, That's the Paddy's cure, When he's on the drinking. See the lassies smile, Laughing all the while, At me darling style, 'Twould set your heart a-bubbling. Asked me was I hired, The wages I required, Till I was almost tired, Of the rocky road to Dublin. One, two, three, four, five Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road and all the way to Dublin, whack-fol-la-de-da! In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity, To be so soon deprived, A view of that fine city. Decided to take a stroll, All among the quality, My bundle it was stole, In a neat locality; Something crossed my mind, When I looked behind; No bundle could I find, Upon me stick a wobbling. Enquiring for a rogue, They said me Connacht brogue, Wasn't much in vogue, On the rocky road to Dublin. One, two, three, four, five Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road and all the way to Dublin, whack-fol-la-de-da! From there I got away, Me spirits never failing Landed on the quay just as the ship was sailing; Captain at me roared, Said that no room had he, then I jumped aboard, A cabin found for Paddy, Down among the pigs played some funny rigs, Danced some hearty jigs, The water round me bubbling, When off to Holyhead, Wished myself was dead, Or better far instead, On the rocky road to Dublin. One, two, three, four, five Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road and all the way to Dublin, whack-fol-la-de-da! The boys of Liverpool, When we safely landed, Called meself a fool; I could no longer stand it; Blood began to boil, Temper I was losing, Poor old Erin's isle They began abusing, \"Hurrah my soul,\" sez I, Let the shillelagh fly; Some Galway boys were nigh, Saw I was a hobbling, With a loud hurray, They joined me in the fray. Soon we cleared the way, O'er the rocky road to Dublin. One, two, three, four, five Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road and all the way to Dublin, whack-fol-la-de-da!

      "\"Heroes From Our Past\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"Heroes From Our Past\" And so the story's told of a hearty group of men it's a tale of their triumphs and their woes. Be it raids and melees ancient or the modern worker's struggle that inspires men to stand up for their rights. And should we fall down by the wayside in this ever-changing world we can look back to these heroes of our past. With their staunch determination and ferocious iron will, no tyranny would quell them in their task. It's an age-old situation with an ever-present message: that time and tide waiteth for no man. So without fear of confrontation of the consequence of outcome, it's for freedom and for happiness they toiled. An in looking to the future, we can see a better place where we can shake the yoke of tyranny for all. It's been paved by generations who have gone now to their rest. It's just remembrance of their dignity we ask. [Chorus:] So come on rally round this brave and valiant cause with tradition, pride, and honor at its core. With swords drawn to defend stood these noble-hearted men fÃ¡g an bealach, clear the way, me boys!! Under perilous conditions with small hope of success they left behind the lives that they once led and by virtue of their fortitude and single-minded strength they cleared the way for the people of today so when we think back to our ancestors respectfully we hark and thank the men whose struggle broke the chain it's a long road up ahead of us let's forge on while we're strong and leave our mark of honor once again So the story has been told and it comes now to an end. It's setting any era, any land. When abusive tyrants force the hands of matters great or small, it inpires men to stand up for their rights.

Come on all you good rats we'll send you to heaven you'll find the pearly gates in the froth and the foam 'cause in these vats you've made quite a creation a potion that turned the Guinness to gold! Like mice behind a piper, rats from all around soon headed for this factory in old Dublin Town.

I take a look around me and I wonder how things change so much in the few short years since I was a young boy. Do you know what we're fighting for? I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward. [Chorus:] I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war to the new American way. The morals of this nation's youth have long gone astray lead by tolerance, indifference, and this kinder gentler way that has corrupted and destroyed so many of our boys and girls oh Lord I start to wonder will it ever come around?

I recall when I was small I thought I'd be a legend soon But that was then and this is now A harder road could not be found Don't get me wrong good times were had Sometimes the fun outweighed the bad But all in all now said and done I can recall more bad than fun. It's killing me - the answers here, it's plain to see It's killing me - I'm half the man I thought I'd be It's killing me - It's taken years but now I see It's taken years but now I see I'm not the man I'd thought I'd be. I'd fight them all big or small, Angel dust and bud tall Collars up and fists the same Protect your friends and family name Had my lumps, received a few But not near what I deserved Some say this life's my punishment Some say this life's my justice served.

Another busted knuckle, taken down by a kick to the balls You've wasted time, wasting time As life's shadow grows so tall It's another busted knuckle It's a fight you'll never win And now you bow your head in shame For a sin no one forgives [Chorus:] Fight fight you'll never win (this is our life) Tonight ill start again (this is our time) Fight fight you'll never win (this is our life) How will I make amends (this is our time) This is our life This is our time This is my life Don't waste my time. Your wife cant understand you And you've alienated your oldest friends Breaking back and fingers to the bone Burning candles at both ends Tired of this petty life you lead A series of dull events A two-bit, half-assed effigy Of someone else's dread Another busted knuckle, taken down by a kick to the balls You've wasted time, wasting time As life's shadow grows so tall It's another busted knuckle It's a fight you'll never win And now you bow your head in shame For a sin no one forgives [Chorus x2] Submit Corrections Writer(s): Barr Alexander, Casey Kenneth William, Kelly Mathew Edward, Lynch James Patrick, Orrell Marc John AZLyrics D Dropkick Murphys Lyrics album: \"Blackout\" (2003) Walk Away Worker's Song The Outcast Black Velvet Band Gonna Be A Blackout Tonight World Full Of Hate Buried Alive The Dirty Glass Fields Of Athenry Bastards On Parade As One This Is Your Life Time To Go Kiss Me, I'm Shitfaced Search\n",

      "\"John Law\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"John Law\" Now let me tell you about a man named John Law He's a neighborhood cop, the toughest man I ever saw A man who knows his duty, a man with a gun To the people in the neighborhood John Law is number one Freeze, we said stop (His name was John Law) For John Law, neighborhood cop (A man we know and love) When John Law's not kicking ass on robbers and rapist He's helping little kids deliver newspapers When John Law's not chasing crackheads from their perch He's helping old ladies on their way to church Freeze, we said stop (His name was John Law) For John Law, neighborhood cop (A man we know and love) He walks the beat Riding scumbags from the streets He turns his eye to petty crime Cause John Law will never drop a dime Suburban anarchists who've never broke the law Sing about police oppression, but they've never met John Law He doesn't fuck with young kids drinking in the Park But he makes the city safe for women after dark Freeze, we said stop (His name was John Law) For John Law, neighborhood cop (A man we know and love) Submit Corrections Writer(s): Kenneth Casey AZLyrics D Dropkick Murphys Lyrics Search\n",

Mick Jones nicked my pudding Oi! Mick Jones leave my pudding alone Life ain't always fair when your hero breaks your heart I was really in denial from the start I owned all his records, he didn't even care The least he could've done was share Resentment it's a killer, that's all you gotta know To forgive a living legend is the only way to go But he really wasn't sorry, I may have seen him laugh As he ate the tasty treat on my behalf Oi! Mick Jones nicked my pudding Oi! Mick Jones leave my pudding alone Oi! Mick Jones nicked my pudding Oi! Mick Jones leave my pudding alone Mick Jones you must've been high You stole pudding from another guy Oi! Mick Jones nicked my pudding Oi! Mick Jones leave my pudding alone Oi!

      "\"Regular Guy\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"Regular Guy\" I've got two hands in my pocket and a pistol to my head as I walk the line in front of me there's no looking back. As I trudge the path of destiny my opinion doesn't pay, I'm a blue collar simple mind who cannot find his way.  His Way.  His Way.  His Way.  Now my Mind set may vary but here I still lay Don't know how I got here or think I care to stay The past will be present if I dare to forget I've got two feet in the future but its not here yet Here Yet.  Here Yet.  Here Yet.  This life is here to stay, and you can't take my pride away I was born in to this life, and these are the cards I'm delt I've got two hands in my pocket and a pistol to my head as I walk the line in front of me there's no looking back.

      "\"The Chosen Few\" lyrics Dropkick Murphys Lyrics \"The Chosen Few\" (special guests vocals by Dicky Barrett (MMB), Danny Gallagher and Michelle Darosa) Allow me to tell a story about our little town, The big movies film here now and the stars all hang around, Some celebs are from here but we still hope they know That weâre the ones that made you, weâll decide when you can go. We canât stand your success, we aren't afraid to let it show, Just ask Lenny Clark, heâll be sure to tell you so. Weâre arguing for sport here, and itching for a fight, Weâre obsessed with your presence, Yet repulsed by your sight. God loves the city's chosen few congrats to one and all, Youâve battled to the top my friends, now weâre ready for your fall, Youâve reached new heights and seen the sights, Smell the roses while you can, For another star is falling in Boston tonight! Weâre creatures of habit, nothing ever changes here. 2 a.m last call, so you better buy more beer. When our teams win it all, all we getâs a rolling rally, And every goddamn functionâs MCâd by Mike O'mally. It's 2008 and new kids are still the rage, Well at least we know when they play Peter Wolf wonât come on stage. The church is in a bind, thereâs trouble in the halls, But itâs that senator from Arlington that tried to grab my balls. God loves the city's chosen few congrats to one and all, Youâve battled to the top my friends, now weâre ready for your fall, Youâve reached new heights and seen the sights, Smell the roses while you can, For another star is falling in Boston tonight! If your name ain't Russell, Williams, Brady, Ortiz, Yaz, Orr, Bird, This place can be a little tough, some might say absurd. Dale and Holly build you up while the big show tears you down, Just like Edgar Renteria, weâll ship you out of town. But itâs the GMâs and the owners whoâll take it on the chin, Cause we donât want excuses, we just wanna win. Ya see when losing your everyoneâs enemy, I wish Henry, Kraft and Wyc would kick the shit out of Jeremy. God loves the city's chosen few congrats to one and all, Youâve battled to the top my friends, now weâre ready for your fall, Youâve reached new heights and seen the sights, Smell the roses while you can, For another star is falling in Boston tonight! How about those âAutomaticsâ, Ernieâs got a lot of fans. They donât sleep in cheap hotels or ride in crappy vans. Theyâre headed for the top, though they may not be there yet, Theyâre still the only bar band thatâs touring in a jet. And donât forget our actors, Chapman, Scannell, Lynch and Goodman, The directors always seem to make our hometown guys the hoodlum, But iâll tell ya finding talent in this town it ainât easy, Even Marty had to use a lousy local band from Quincy. God loves the city's chosen few congrats to one and all, youâve battled to the top my friends, now weâre ready for your fall, youâve reached new heights and seen the sights, smell the roses while you can, for another star is falling in Boston tonight!
